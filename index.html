                    <p><strong>The curiosity and desire to paint began around the age of five and have self-taught to the present day.</strong>                        I am fascinated at how paint can create the illusion of three dimension, light and dark, warmth and
                        cold. I am drawn to the way a picture can pull out emotion from the viewer and how you can return
                        to a favourite picture many times and still get a sensation from it. </p>
                    <p>I was first inspired by the impressionists’ paintings such as Sisley’s landscapes, the pastel sketches
                        of Degas and the studies made en plein air by Sorrola. I admire the watercolours of Edward Seago
                        and am constantly inspired by the work of Ken Howard. </p>

                    <p>I like my paintings to be a journey for the viewer, in order to achieve this, my paintings often show
                        all of the stages from the beginning to the completed piece. I enjoy to paint all subjects, however
                        have limited this to Equine and Water. My sold pieces show a wide variety of the work I do produce
                        for my customers, along with the large number of pieces available in my home studio. </p>
                    <p>
                        I am producing the pieces shown on the website to sell and to be shown in galleries; but do accept commissions for any subject
                        of work.</p>
