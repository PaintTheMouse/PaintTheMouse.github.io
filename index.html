                <p><strong>The curiosity and desire to paint began around the age of five and have self-taught to the present day.</strong>                    I am fascinated at how paint can create the illusion of three dimension, light and dark, warmth and cold.
                    I am drawn to the way a picture can pull out emotion from the viewer and how you can return to a favourite
                    picture many times and still get a sensation from it. </p>
                <p>I was first inspired by the impressionists’ paintings such as Sisley’s landscapes, the pastel sketches of
                    Degas and the studies made en plein air by Sorrola. I admire the watercolours of Edward Seago and am
                    constantly inspired by the work of Ken Howard. </p>
                <blockquote class="largeQuote">“A picture can pull out emotion from the viewer...” <br/>- Ray Murphy</blockquote>
                <p>I like my paintings to be a journey for the viewer, in order to achieve this, my paintings often show all
                    of the stages from the beginning to the completed piece. I enjoy to paint all subjects, however have
                    limited this to Equine and Water. My sold pieces show a wide variety of the work I do produce for my
                    customers, along with the large number of pieces available in my home studio. </p>
                <p>
                    I am producing the pieces shown on the website to sell and to be shown in galleries; but do accept commissions for any subject
                    of work.</p>
