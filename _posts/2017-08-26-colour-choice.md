A couple of years ago I realised I wasn't happy with my colour choice for my oil palette. So, I decided to put them all in a box and forget about them and concentrate more on a very limited palette to see if I could produce more harmonious pieces of work.

After some research I settled on three primary colours plus black and white.
My colours are Cerulean Blue - Magenta - Winsor Yellow - Lamp Black - Titanium White.

It's been an interesting period discovering just how much can be achieved with such a limited range of colours particularly as I had some equine paintings to do which proved to be a challenge without my earth colours but the end results I think are ok.

Here are a few samples of the paintings done with the limited palette.
