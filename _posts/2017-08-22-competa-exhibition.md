So, my first exhibition since 1995. That one was in Barking Essex and went very well, in fact it was a sell out as I recall. So here I am again only 22 years later doing another one.
This time I was in the mountain town of Competa in the Axarquia region of southern Spain. The exhibition was in July and lasted 3 weeks, it went well and we sold about 20 pieces of work.

I was also commissioned to do a large "ish" piece of work for a guy who was opening a new B&B in the town. It turned out that he was having his opening night at the end of the week and that he wanted the paintings to go in his lobby. So I got a new canvas

and was up at 6.30 in the morning for several mornings to get the work down in time for his opening night. We got it done in time and he was very happy with the end result. 

Competa has a fiesta to celebrate the Noche Del Vino ( night of the wine ) on the 15th August each year as Competa is famous for producing a very nice muscatel wine. Each year at the Town Hall a design is chosen for the Noche del Vino poster and this year on my first attempt I was lucky enough to have my design chosen . I'm really pleased about it as the posters are quite collectible and are often seen in restaurants and bodegas in and area the town.
Well there you have it, my first blog.

Here are a few more photos of it.
