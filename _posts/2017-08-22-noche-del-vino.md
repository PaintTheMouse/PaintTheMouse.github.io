Competa has a fiesta to celebrate the Noche Del Vino ( night of the wine ) on the 15th August each year as Competa is famous for producing a very nice muscatel wine.

Each year at the Town Hall a design is chosen for the Noche del Vino poster and this year on my first attempt I was lucky enough to have my design chosen.

I'm really pleased about it as the posters are quite collectible and are often seen in restaurants and bodegas in and area the town.
